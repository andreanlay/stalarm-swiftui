This app is a project from one of my challenge in Apple Developer Academy.

Stalarm is an iOS app that helps you reduce procrastination by forcing you to move when stopping an alarm. This app is an improved version from [this one](https://github.com/andreanlay/stalarm).

Stalarm is built using:
1. SwiftUI
2. Combine
3. AVFoundation
4. Core Data
5. Core Motion
6. User Notifications
